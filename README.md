# LabMate
As someone whoâ€™s worked in brain surgery and stem cell labs, I know how chaotic protocols can be. LabMate is the AI lab partner I wish I had.

This is an AI-Powered Lab Protocol Optimization Tool:
Built an interactive Streamlit web application that serves as an AI copilot for laboratory protocols.

Integrated OpenAI GPT models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5) to analyze, restructure, and optimize scientific protocols for clarity, efficiency, and parallelization opportunities.

Implemented file ingestion pipeline supporting .pdf, .txt, and .md formats using PyPDF2 and custom parsing, with fallback for manual input.

Developed context-aware instruction templates for diverse lab workflows (PCR, RNA extraction, surgical procedures, cell culture, etc.), with support for customizable and reusable presets.

Added session persistence for saving/loading user templates, improving workflow reproducibility.

Delivered features like automated error detection, optimized step reordering with time savings, safety checklists, and downloadable structured outputs.

Designed UI/UX for scientists to easily import protocols, edit instructions, and obtain actionable, optimized outputs without coding knowledge.
